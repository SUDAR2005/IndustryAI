1. System Architecture Overview:
- Backend: Python-based microservices architecture
- Frontend: React-based dashboard
- Database: PostgreSQL for structured data, MongoDB for documents
- Cloud Infrastructure: AWS/Azure for scalability

2. Data Collection Implementation: (To Do: search source)
- Created DataCollector class to:
  - Interface with various APIs (government, NGO databases)
  - Handle data validation and cleaning
  - Store standardized data format
- Uses async operations for efficient data gathering
- Implements retry mechanisms for API failures

3. Project Scoring System: (To Do: Fix data considered)
- Project Scorer class implements:
  - Environmental impact calculation using emissions data
  - Social impact assessment using NLP on project documents
  - Governance scoring based on compliance metrics
- Uses transformer-based NLP models for document analysis
- Implements weighted scoring system for different factors

4. Optimization Engine: (Study this completely)
- Optimization Engine class features:
  - Linear programming solver for portfolio optimization
  - Risk-adjusted return calculations
  - Budget constraint handling
  - Diversity requirements implementation
- Uses PuLP for optimization problems
- Handles multiple constraint types simultaneously

5. Risk Prediction:
- RiskPredictor class implements:
  - Deep learning model for risk assessment
  - Historical data analysis
  - Climate risk integration
  - Market volatility consideration

6. Dashboard Implementation Steps:
```javascript
// Dashboard components needed:
1. Project Overview Panel
2. Portfolio Optimization View
3. Risk Analysis Dashboard
4. ESG Impact Visualizations
```

7. Integration Steps:
a) Set up data pipelines
b) Implement API endpoints
c) Create authentication system
d) Deploy microservices
e) Set up monitoring
